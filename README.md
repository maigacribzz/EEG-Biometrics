# EEG-Biometrics

This repository is for final project paper "STIMULUS EFFECT ON EEG-BASED AUTHENTICATION SYSTEMS". Zenodo BED: Biometric EEG Dataset was used for the training of the data. It can be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/record/4309472#.YVDNpH0pC70 This dataset comprises EEG responses from 21 subjects to 12 different stimuli, across 3 different chronologically disjointed sessions. EEG data from randomly selected subjects were preprocessed in matlab and feature extractions were also performed. Finally, outputs are saved in a .xlsx Excel spreadsheet. Visual Studio code is used to load data and machine learning is performed on dataset using Python and it's vast libraries.
